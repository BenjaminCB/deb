# Requirements
### Exercise 1:
What types of requirements exist?

>Conventionally, requirements are divided into two types: functional and non-functional. Functional requirements are what the system must do; non-functional requirements are the qualities that the system must have. These qualities may be crucial factors in the acceptability, sales or usage of a product. Non-functional requirements cover a number of aspects of design, including image and aesthetics, usability, UX, performance, maintainability, security, cultural acceptability and legal restrictions.

### Exercise 2:
What characterizes the different types of requirements?

> Hopefully referring to MoSCoW.
>
> - **Must have**: Fundamental requirements without which the system will be unworkable and useless, effectively the minimum usable subset.
> - **Should have**: Would be essential if more time were available, but the system will be useful and usable without them.
> - **Could have**: Of lesser importance, therefore can more easily be left out of the current development.
> - **Want to have but Won't have this time round**: Can wait until a later development.

### Exercise 3:
How can requirements be represented in a requirements specification?

Don't really know what is meant by the question.

### Exercise 4:
What characterizes a "good" requirement? How should a good requirement be phrased?



### Exercise 5:
How can requirements be prioritized?

### Exercise 6:
Who decides which priority to give the requirements? And how is this decided?

# Data Collection
### Exercise 1:
Which of the following are considered qualitative data collection methods?

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Cultural probes
- Observation

Why?

### Exercise 2:
Which of the following are considered quantitative data collection methods?

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Cultural probes
- Observation

Why?

### Exercise 3:
Which of the following can be considered both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods?

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Cultural probes
- Observation

Why?

### Exercise 4:
What would be the best data collection method for gathering data in this situation: Your informants are part of a different community than your own. You want to get an understanding of their everyday lives and habits in using technologies at home. Which method of data collection techniques would be most suitable?

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Cultural probes
- Observation

Why?

### Exercise 5:
How many forms of interviews are there and how would you describe these?

### Exercise 6:
What are the benefits and drawbacks of the different interview forms?

### Exercise 7:
What are some considerations you should take into account in terms of the language of interview questions, i.e. formulating questions?

### Exercise 8:
What are some benefits of observations compared to interviews?

### Exercise 9:
In which situations would it be most suitable to use questionnaires over interviews?

### Case 1: Data gathering in a hospital ward
Imagine the following use context for a software system: Nurses and doctors work together in a hospital ward where children with serious illnesses (e.g. acute respiratory symptoms) are being treated. The ward is filled with technical equipment. The children come in with their parents, and the staff need to both treat the childrensâ€™ health conditions and consult and update their systems with information while also calming the children and informing their parents about the procedures.

You need to design a mobile app which shows a dashboard overview of data from various sensors (such as an electrocardiogram for monitoring heart rate). This is used to monitor the health of the children and warn staff about a change in physical conditions of the children in this use context.

Conduct a PACT-analysis of this scenario. Which of the following data collection techniques would you find suitable for gaining an understanding of the use context?
- Interviews
- Focus group interviews
- Questionnaires
- Cultural probes
- In situ observation
- Artefact collection
- Usability evaluation

* Why these data collection techniques?
* Who would you include in the data collection and in what activities?
* Are there any of the techniques that you would not use in this context and why not?
* If you choose to conduct observations, which ethical issues would you consider in this specific situation?
* If you choose to conduct artefact collection, which ethical issues would you consider in this specific situation?
* If you choose to interview a doctor, what practical considerations would you take into account?
* If you choose to interview a child, what practical considerations would you take into account?


### Practical exercise 1:
Split the project group in two subteams (teams do not need to be the same sizes). Within each subteam you must select one interviewer and one interviewee. The interview must be at least 15 minutes. The purpose is to gain insights into the interviewees' use of smartphones and the impact of such use on everyday life. All other subteam members take notes during the interviews. After 15 minutes, you meet again in the project group and, based on the notes, identify commonalities in findings between the two subteams.
