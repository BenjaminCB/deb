# Exercise 1
**What is the 'perceptual set' and which factors go into defining this?**

![](perceptual_set.png)

# Exercise 2
**What characterizes the gestalt laws of perception, discuss in the groups and find user interface examples of these:**

- Proximity
- Continuity
- Similarity
- Closure

# Exercise 3
**What is affordance?**

> An affordance is a resource that the environment offers an animal and...the animal must possess the capabilities to perceive and use the resource.

Such as when we see a door handle we know that the door can be opened but other animals might not.

# Exercise 4
**Find good and bad examples of affordances in everyday objects (one example per group member) and take turns describing them. Why are these good or bad?**

^^^

# Exercise 5
Find good and bad examples of affordances in user interface designs (one example per group member) and take turns describing them. Why are these good or bad?

I think icons on websites are a pretty good example or buttons with color, such as accept cookie button.

# Exercise 6
How is the 'perceptual set' connected to the gestalt laws and the affordances we make in our perception of objects?

# Exercise 7
What are the primary- and secondary depth cues?

See slides for depth perception

# Exercise 8
Find 2 examples of user interface designs; one that uses depth cues and one that does not.

Which depth cues are represented in the design that includes these?

Does the design without depth cues seem user-friendly, even if it does not employ these cues? If so, why do you think that is the case?

I think depth cuos can certainly be helpful if you have a UI with lots of information such as. Such a webbrowser which gives the impression that its UI is in front of the actual page.

# Exercise 9
How are depth cues related to the 'perceptual set' and affordance?

# Exercise 10
Explain the three activities involved in navigating through an environment?

From your own experience, find examples of these activities when navigation around a new physical environment, e.g. your first day in Aalborg.

# Exercise 11
Which three types of signs are used to facilitate navigation activities?

# Exercise 12
Find good and bad examples of the three navigational signs in the following types of user interfaces:

- Command prompt
- Web application
- Mobile app

Why do these examples provide good or bad navigational signs?

# Exercise 13
Based on the bad examples in the previous exercise, redesign the user interfaces (using pen/paper or Balsamiq) to provide more usable navigational signs.
