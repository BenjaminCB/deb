### Attention Exercise 1
What characterizes ’the Stroop effect’ and when does it occur? Find examples to illustrate this and test it yourselves.

That two aspects of your design choice are constricting each other on a subconscious level, such as a a red yes button combined with a green no button.

### Attention Exercise 2
What is the difference between ‘selective’ and ‘divided’ attention, and how do these types of attention relate to ‘the cocktail party effect’?

Selective is when we select something to focus on something out of many, while divided means that we try to split our attention between multiple different things.

How is this relevant within user interface design?

### Attention Exercise 3
Find 6 examples of user interface designs, that support selective and divided attention (3 of each type of attention). Discuss in the group why each is selective or divided.

- WoW
- Destiny
-

### Attention Exersise 4
Discuss situations where you have experienced ‘the cocktail party effect’ – come up with concrete examples.

- GM in ttrpg

List 5 different questions that you would ask a future user of a system that you are designing. The questions must uncover whether you should design for selective or divided attention.

### Attention Exercise 6
How are mental workload and attention connected?

How can we measure mental workload?

NASA taskload index

Simple design

### Attention Exercise 12
What is the difference between recall and recognition?

Recalling is retrieving from your memory. Recognition is recognising something in your environment which is in your memory.

How is it relevant to user interface design?

We should focus on recognition as it is easier for the user.

### Attention Exercise 13
Find one example of ‘chunking’ (in apps, websites etc.) per group member, and discuss potential design improvements/further information grouping.

Pick one of the examples and use pen and paper or Balsamiq to redesign the user interface. Apply gestalt principles and consider forms of attention in your design.
