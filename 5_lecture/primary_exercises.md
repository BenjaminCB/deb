### Attention Exercise 1
What characterizes ’the Stroop effect’ and when does it occur? Find examples to illustrate this and test it yourselves.

That two aspects of your design choice are constricting each other on a subconscious level, such as a a red yes button combined with a green no button.

### Attention Exercise 2
What is the difference between ‘selective’ and ‘divided’ attention, and how do these types of attention relate to ‘the cocktail party effect’?

Selective is when we select something to focus on something out of many, while divided means that we try to split our attention between multiple different things.

> The cocktail party effect is the phenomenon of the brain's ability to focus one's auditory attention on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli, such as when a partygoer can focus on a single conversation in a noisy room.

How is this relevant within user interface design?

The interface should be easy to use and not be noisy to the point where you can no longer focus on one thing.

### Attention Exercise 3
Find 6 examples of user interface designs, that support selective and divided attention (3 of each type of attention). Discuss in the group why each is selective or divided.

- Selective
    - Phone
    - Youtube
- Divided
    - WoW
    - Control system

### Attention Exersise 4
Discuss situations where you have experienced ‘the cocktail party effect’ – come up with concrete examples.

- GM in ttrpg

### Attention Exercise 5
List 5 different questions that you would ask a future user of a system that you are designing. The questions must uncover whether you should design for selective or divided attention.

### Attention Exercise 6
How are mental workload and attention connected?

High workload low attention

How can we measure mental workload?

NASA taskload index

### Attention Exercise 7

### Attention Exercise 8
Find one example of an interface design (websites, apps etc.) per group member that displays an overwhelming amount of information leading to a low level of usability.

Pick one of the examples and use pen and paper or Balsamiq to redesign the user interface. Apply gestalt principles and consider forms of attention in your design.

### Attention Exercise 9
For how long can a user at maximum be expected to hold information in their working memory at a time?

Roughly 30s (look up in book)

How is this relevant to user interface design?

Obviously the user should not have to remember things for longer than this.

### Exercise Exercise 10
How many items of information can a user at maximum be expected to hold in their working memory at a time?

4 +/- 1

How is this relevant to user interface design?

How many items should be in "lists"

### Attention Exercise 11
How can we, through the use of GUI design principles, reduce the memory load of the user?

Simple design. Gradually show more detailed information as the user actually needs it.

### Attention Exercise 12
What is the difference between recall and recognition?

Recalling is retrieving from your memory. Recognition is recognising something in your environment which is in your memory.

How is it relevant to user interface design?

We should focus on recognition as it is easier for the user.

### Attention Exercise 13
Find one example of ‘chunking’ (in apps, websites etc.) per group member, and discuss potential design improvements/further information grouping.

- Products on websites
- Menus
- Filters

Pick one of the examples and use pen and paper or Balsamiq to redesign the user interface. Apply gestalt principles and consider forms of attention in your design.
